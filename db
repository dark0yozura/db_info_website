<p> <h4>Goku Black (ゴクウブラック Gokū Burakku), also known as Zamasu (ザマス Zamasu), though usually referred to as Black, is an alternate incarnation of Zamasu and a former North Kai and Supreme Kai apprentice serving his former master Gowasu from the unaltered main timeline within Universe 10. He serves as the main antagonist of the "Future" Trunks Saga of Dragon Ball Super.

Black visited Universe 6, went to the Super Dragon Balls from the unaltered main timeline within that universe, summoned Super Shenron from said timeline, wished to switch bodies with Goku from the unaltered main timeline within Universe 7, and Super Shenron granted Goku Black's wish. Goku Black sought to destroy all mortals alongside Future Zamasu, an alternate counterpart of him.

When he arrived to Future Trunks's timeline, he initially referred to himself as Goku. However, due to the notable style and color difference between Black and Goku's clothings, he was given the name "Goku Black" by Future Bulma and thus took the name even when he revealed his own identity </h4> </p> </font>

<h1> <font color="#FF007F"> <u> personality </u> </font> </h1>
<p> <h4> <font color="white"> Before acting on his dark impulses, as Zamasu, he was a calm and patient individual, willing to listen to his teacher's words. However, he long harbored an utter hatred for mortals, perceiving them as a blasphemy and the gods' greatest mistake. He also came to hate the gods as well for not doing anything about their "mistake". After giving in to his desires, Zamasu mercilessly killed his former master as his first step down a dark path. Despite his cruel, aggressive, and certainly unsympathetic actions, even to his own kind, Zamasu feels perfectly vindicated, truly seeing no evil in his actions, after he scoured several timelines as proof that mortals are a corruption of existence as a whole that prevents it from becoming a true paradise.

He uses mortals as the scapegoat for his misdeeds, using Future Trunks' violation of time travel as justification for his and Future Zamasu's morally questionable goal of exterminating all life (similar to Android 13, who also uses mortal shortcomings to justify his carnage). He also believes that humanity has only continued to exist for all this time because the gods are too prideful to acknowledge their failure in creating mortals. Also, rather than using the Super Dragon Balls from the unaltered main timeline within Universe 6 to wish for mortals to be exterminated, he preferred to wish to switch bodies with Goku from the unaltered main timeline within Universe 7, displaying his infatuation with the Saiyan. This also seems to suggest that he wanted to destroy mortals by himself, as he believed that it was his own responsibility as if he were the Supreme God.</font> </h4> </p>

<h1> <p align="center"> <font color="white"> <u> GOGETA </font> </u> </p> </h1>

<P> <H4> <font color="white">Gogeta (ゴジータ Gojīta) is the Metamoran fusion of Goku and Vegeta when they perform the Fusion Dance properly. His voice is a dual voice containing both Goku's and Vegeta's voices. Like his Potara counterpart; Vegito, he is regarded as one of the most powerful characters in the entire Dragon Ball franchise, combining the power of Goku and Vegeta and even magnifying them to become even more powerful.

Gogeta first debuted in Fusion Reborn as the final protagonist when Goku and Vegeta fused in Hell to defeat Super Janemba. He returned in Dragon Ball GT as a Super Saiyan 4 to battle Omega Shenron, but defused quicker than expected due to over-using too much power. He would then make his canon debut in Broly as the final protagonist, similar to his role from Fusion Reborn.</h4> </p> </font>

<h1> <font color="yellow"> <u> personality </u> </font> </h1>
<p> <h4> <font color="white"> Fusion Reborn, Gogeta is shown to be a confident, cold and relatively silent character, boldly proclaiming himself as Janemba's end at first but then ruthlessly eliminating him with little to no words spoken afterwards. This differs him from Vegito, who enjoys taunting and humiliating opponents as well as prolonging battles to inflict as much punishment as possible, whereas Gogeta seeks to eviscerate his opponents as quickly as possible, a unique trait from his fusees due to his their Saiyan DNA typically holding them back from ending fights immediately.

Gogeta was shown chuckling after scaring Saike Demon at the end of Fusion Reborn, suggesting he is not as cold as he comes off. In several Dragon Ball games, his personality draws mostly from the cheerful and energetic Goku to differentiate him from Vegito.</p> </h4> </font>

<h1> <p align=center> <font color="white"> <u> VEGITO </u> </font> </h1>
<img src="file:///C:\Users\Dell\Desktop\yozura.sth\1016225.jpg" width="400" height="242" align=left>

<p> <h4> <font color="white">Vegito (ベジット Bejitto), also known as Vegerot in the Viz English manga, is the resulting fusion between Goku and Vegeta by the use of the Potara Earrings. Like his Fusion Dance counterpart, Gogeta, Vegito is regarded as one of the most powerful characters in the original Dragon Ball manga.

Vegito first appeared at the end of Z episode "Union of Rivals" to start battling with Super Buu, with his second appearance in the next episode "Meet Vegito" as the main protagonist throughout the entire episode. His debut in Dragon Ball Super was many years later to fight and attempt to defeat Fused Zamasu, though they quickly defused due to over-usage of power.</h4> </p> </font>

<h1> <font color="blue"> <u> personality </u> </font> </h1>
<p> <h4> <font color="white"> Vegito's personality is a mixture of both Goku and Vegeta's characteristics. He exhibits Vegeta's cockiness and inclination for taunting others, and enjoys toying with enemies, but is not as serious, having inherited Goku's easygoing, cheerful nature. He possesses both Vegeta's strategic mind and tactical skills along with Goku's ingenuity and creativity, making him that much more efficient. Despite appearing cocky, he in fact retains Goku's benevolence and empathy. Being a whole new entity, he refers to his counterparts as separate people as they would address each other. During his fight with Super Buu, Vegito also showed signs of having a sense of humor, such as after Buu transformed Vegito into candy, Vegito claimed he wasn't no ordinary candy, but a jawbreaker and the "strongest candy there is".

However, he still retains the memories of each individual and can clearly distinguish between the two. This was shown when he stated he was wondering what would happen if "they" (Goku and Vegeta) merged, though he also referred to himself as "us" when talking about "sharing a body". In the original dub, he maintains Goku's respectful nature, referring to Old Kai as Dai Kaiōshin-sama.

In Dragon Ball Super, when Vegito returns at the near end of the "Future" Trunks Saga, his personality is mostly the same except he is far more serious than last time due to his opponent not needing to worry about any loved ones' safety and now knowing about his fusion's time limit. He is still somewhat cocky, tending to mock his opponent for things like sloppy fighting and ignorance of the situation.</p> </h4> </font>
